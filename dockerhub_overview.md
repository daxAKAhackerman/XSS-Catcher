# What is XSS Catcher?

XSS Catcher is an intuitive tool that automates blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and data gathering, including screenshots. It features a user-friendly payload generator for creating customizable XSS payloads and offers robust functionalities like webhook and email notifications, multi-factor authentication, and multi-user access. Designed to be straightforward, it integrates easily with platforms such as Slack and Discord, captures comprehensive data including cookies, local storage, and session storage, and provides detailed insights like HTTP headers and DOM snapshots. Additionally, it supports API keys for advanced automation, streamlining XSS testing and making complex attack scenarios more accessible and manageable.
